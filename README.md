# AI-Intent Standard (AIS) v1.3.0

A universal, machine-readable standard for AI governance in digital directories, repositories, and websites.

## 🚀 Why AIS?
Traditional `robots.txt` is limited to domain-level access and crawl control. AIS provides a granular way to establish **Semantic Jurisdiction** over specific folders or content, telling AI Agents exactly how they can process your data after access.

## 🤝 Compatibility with robots.txt
AIS is 100% compatible with `robots.txt`. While `robots.txt` manages **access** (can I enter?), AIS manages **intent and behavior** (what can I do with this information?). They work best when used together as dual layers of protection.

## 🛠️ How to use
1. Place `ai-intent.txt` in the root of your directory, repository, or web folder.
2. Define your Allow/Disallow directives.
3. Any AI Runtime or Agent processing this path is governed by your intent.
